Starter commands:
pip install virtualenv
/home/jbidaux/.local/bin/virtualenv env

. env/bin/activate
This command activates the virtual environment. Upon activation, the shellâ€™s prompt might change to include the name of the activated environment (in this case, (env)), 
and it modifies the environment variables such as PATH so that the Python interpreter and scripts within the env directory are used in preference to the system-wide Python installation. 
This means that when you invoke Python or install new packages using pip, it will operate in the context of the virtual environment.

We remove db.sqlite3 because we'll use Postgres

In the dockerfile, WORKDIR "sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD instructions that follow it. 
If the specified working directory doesn't exist, it will create it with the necessary permissions before proceeding with the rest of the Dockerfile's commands. 
This behavior effectively makes WORKDIR function similarly to the mkdir -p command, ensuring that the directory exists."
